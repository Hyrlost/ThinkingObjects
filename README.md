# Thinking Objects

Hi! I'm Hyrlost. I just want to let you know what the mod is.
It was my first mod related to Minecraft, where I was inspired by this [video](https://youtu.be/OX1vO4lIIws). In this mod, I had to create a totally new entity because it was not a living entity and the entity don't require the living entity behavior. Also, I had to create a new packet and modify a bit the FabricEntityType because I had to send a new variable to set correctly the "thought". And I played a bit with sending data because as it is random, sometimes the item to render or the item to spawn is different but it went very well.

I just want to tell you I don't have abilities to make designs haha, so it is the reason that I am just rendering the item image instead of a "thought cloud" as the video.

If you want to contact me, please add me on discord Hyrlost#6321.
